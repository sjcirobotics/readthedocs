Tools and Resource Access
=========================

Robotics uses quite a few different tools to make sure we stay on top of 
communicating with each other, maintaining documentation, code, and 
design drawings in convenient places. If you don't have access to any 
of the following tools and resources, please contact Mr. Wick, either in 
person, via `Slack <https://alumiboti.slack.com/>`_ or via email at 
`pwick@sjci.com <pwick@sjci.com>`_.

Slack
-----

We use Slack as a messaging platform to easily and effectively communicate 
with the team. Instead of receiving big emails that you probably won't read, 
Slack is a chat app that let's mentors and team members talk to each other 
in different channels and groups catered towards topics. **If you are not in
this channel, please contact Mr. Wick ASAP.**


Google Drive
------------
The team uses Google Drive to store and share documents between each other,
including game manuals, designs and drawings, and so much more! Definitely 
make sure that you are shared with this folder, so that you can access 
everything when you need to. 

With this, you are given full Read/Write permissions to edit, so do not 
abuse it...Google does keep track of history if you mess something up.
